# Description
This project contains the code used in the report of the NLDL'24 Winter School titled "Oceanographic Data Series Cleaning using Deep Learning".

The results were produced on a laptop with the CPU of Intel Core i7-1165G7 processor (8 CPU cores @ 2.80GHz) and 32GB of RAM, and operating on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

# Structure
The project is structured as follow:
- [anomaly_detection_algs](https://github.com/ntnguyen-so/NLDL_report/tree/main/anomaly_detection_algs): contains reproducible code for deep learning anomaly detection algorithms.
- [data_imputation_algs](https://github.com/ntnguyen-so/NLDL_report/tree/main/data_imputation_algs): contains reproducible code for deep learning data imputation algorithms.

An additional data imputation algorithm called CSDI is integrated into the framework under data_imputation_algs by the course participant.
